Dungeon Teller - The Second Reboot
=========
By Aethereal
---------


Dungeon Teller is a simple tool that monitors your dungeon, scenario, raid, battlefield and arena queus in World of Warcraft (WoW).
___

**Current Status**

    - PvE (mostly) working as intended
    - PvP only briefly tested - if anyone wants to confirm this is working ok then that would be great
    - Only the default options have been tested - currently the status of notifications, emails etc. is unknown
    *** Updating has been disabled at the moment while I implement a solution; offsets are still read from offsets.xml ***

**Known Issues**

    - Scenario queue is broken - this will be implemented at a later stage
    - DBC reading is broken - a fudge has been implemented in the meantime (dumped dbcs; should be complete)
    - Queueing for multiple PvE instances is not handled as nicely as PvP, but this is due to the WoW client and cannot be helped :(
    - Code is ugly and needs reworking - but at least it's currently operational ^^
    
**TODO**
    - Implement Scenario Queues (High priority)
    - Clean up code; remove unused stuff etc. (Low priority)
    - Implement Updates system (Medium priority)
